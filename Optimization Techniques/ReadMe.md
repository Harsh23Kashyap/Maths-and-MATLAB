The main objective of the course is to formulate mathematical models
and to understand solution methods for real life optimal decision problems. 
The emphasis
will be on basic study of linear and non-linear programming problems, Integer programming
problem, Transportation problem, Two person zero sum games with economic applications
and project management techniques using CPM.

Scope of Operations Research: Introduction to linear and non-linear programming
formulation of different models.

Linear Programming: Geometry of linear programming, Graphical method, Linear
programming (LP) in standard form, Solution of LP by simplex method, Exceptional cases in
LP, Duality theory, Dual simplex method, Sensitivity analysis.

Integer Programming: Branch and bound technique, Gomoryâ€™s Cutting plane method.

Network Models: Construction of networks, Network computations, Free Floats, Critical
path method (CPM), optimal scheduling (crashing). Initial basic feasible solutions of
balanced and unbalanced transportation problems, optimal solutions, assignment problem.
Multiobjective Programming: Introduction to multiobjective linear programming, efficient
solution, efficient frontier.

Nonlinear Programming:
Unconstrained Optimization: unimodal functions, Fibonacci search method, Steepest
Descent method.

Constrained Optimization: Concept of convexity and concavity, Maxima and minima of
functions of n-variables, Lagrange multipliers, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions for
constrained optimization
Laboratory Work: Lab experiments will be set in consonance with materials covered in the
theory using Matlab.

Course learning outcome: Upon Completion of this course, the students would be able to:
1) formulate the linear and nonlinear programming problems.
2) solve linear programming problems using Simplex method and its variants.
3) construct and optimize various network models.
4) construct and classify multiobjective linear programming problems.
